  summary: This award recognizes excellence in undergraduate work in Data Science and is presented to the recipients at the Data Science Commencement Ceremony.

  summary: After years of work and a website redesign, there was no tool to explore majors at California's public universities. I created that tool and it is now prominently advertised and displayed by the state of California for community college students to use.

  summary: I swear, they didn't give an award for last place! I just named the team "The Team In Last Place" because I thought it would be funny to hear the announcer say "...and the winner is The Team In Last Place!"
